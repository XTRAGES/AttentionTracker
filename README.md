# üéØ Attention Tracker

This project focuses on video analysis, object detection, object tracking, and trajectory prediction.

## üí° Overview

The project utilizes various techniques and models for analyzing video streams, including:

*   **Object Detection:** YOLOv8 (`yolo_v8_tryout.py`) and DETR (Detection Transformer) with ResNet-50 (`detr_resnet_50.py`) are used for object detection.
*   **Object Tracking:**  The `object_tracking_script.py` is responsible for tracking detected objects across video frames.
*   **Trajectory Prediction:** The `predict_trajectory_vector.py` script predicts the trajectories of tracked objects.
*   **Video Streaming:** The `video_feed.py` and `video_stream_script.py` handle video input and streaming.
*   **Attraction Matrix:** The `get_attraction_matrix.py` calculates an attraction matrix, likely used for understanding relationships between objects.
*   **Object List:** The `get_object_list.py` retrieves a list of objects.
